###  Compare and contrast Haskell and Python

* Introduction
* Comparing and contrasting Haskell and Python

## Introduction

This week we will be gaining more understanding of the efficiency of coding in Haskell versus Python.

## Comparing and contrasting Haskell and Python

Needs to be completed with appropriate benchmarking. 
[gnomon](https://github.com/paypal/gnomon)  to measure the time that programs take to run.


## Going Forward
So you've made it through week 4, by now you should be capable in Haskell and have an understanding of the benefits of using Haskell as a purely functional programming language. Go to [blog 5](Blog5.md) to start lambda calculus.
