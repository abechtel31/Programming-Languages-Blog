# Week 2 - Haskell Lab
###  Compare and contrast Haskell and Python

* Introduction
* Haskell Extension to Jupyter Lab
* Hands On Programming

## Introduction

This week we will be gaining more hands on experience coding in Haskell and looking at how recursion works in Haskell.

## Haskell Extension to Jupyter Lab

A helpful tool in case you want to step up your Haskell game is the IHaskell extension to Jupyter Lab. To download go [here](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell). This is the tool I used to create the interactive lab notebook for this week.

## Hands On Comparison

The majority of this weeks content will be found in the [Haskell Notebook](Examples.ipynb). Navigate to the lab file to continue!

## Going Forward
Congratulations on making it through week 2, by now you should be comfortable with basic Haskell syntax, be able to convert programs from an imperative language like Python to Haskell, and have been exposed to more data types. To continue your learning journey go to [lab 3](Blog3.md) to have a deep dive all into recursion.
