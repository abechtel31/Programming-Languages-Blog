## Introduction

This week we will be gaining more hands on experience coding in Haskell. I particularly wanted to introduce a tool I found while learning Haskell which proved quite useful, it provides the ability to run single cells at a time, add sections of markdown in between your code, and more. We will be working in an interactive lab notebook to learn more about various data types in Haskell, particularly lists, and learn how to write basic functions.

* Note: If the lab does not load please make sure the HaskellHandsOn.ipynb is saved in the same directory as your IHaskell program.

## Haskell Extension to Jupyter Lab

A helpful tool in case you want to step up your Haskell game is the IHaskell extension to Jupyter Lab. To download go [here](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell). This is the tool I used to create the interactive lab notebook for this week.

## Hands On Comparison

The majority of this weeks content will be found in the [Haskell Notebook](HaskellHandsOn.ipynb). Navigate to the lab file to continue!

## Going Forward
Congratulations on making it through the blog 2, by now you should be comfortable with basic Haskell syntax, be able to convert programs from an imperative language like Python to Haskell, and have been exposed to more data types. To continue your learning journey go to [blog 3](Blog3.md) to have a deep dive all into recursion.
